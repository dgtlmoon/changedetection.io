### Perform interactive browser steps

Fill in text boxes, click buttons and more, setup your changedetection scenario. 

Using the **Browser Steps** configuration, add basic steps before performing change detection, such as logging into websites, adding a product to a cart, accept cookie logins, entering dates and refining searches.

[<img src="docs/browsersteps-anim.gif" style="max-width:100%;" alt="Website change detection with interactive browser steps, detect changes behind login and password, search queries and more"  title="Website change detection with interactive browser steps, detect changes behind login and password, search queries and more" />](https://changedetection.io?src=github)

After **Browser Steps** have been run, then visit the **Visual Selector** tab to refine the content you're interested in.
Requires Playwright to be enabled.

### Awesome restock and price change notifications

Enable the _"Re-stock & Price detection for single product pages"_ option to activate the best way to monitor product pricing, this will extract any meta-data in the HTML page and give you many options to follow the pricing of the product.

Easily organise and monitor prices for products from the dashboard, get alerts and notifications when the price of a product changes or comes back in stock again!

[<img src="docs/restock-overview.png" style="max-width:100%;" alt="Easily keep an eye on product price changes directly from the UI"  title="Easily keep an eye on product price changes directly from the UI" />](https://changedetection.io?src=github)

Set price change notification parameters, upper and lower price, price change percentage and more.
Always know when a product for sale drops in price.

[<img src="docs/restock-settings.png" style="max-width:100%;" alt="Set upper lower and percentage price change notification values"  title="Set upper lower and percentage price change notification values" />](https://changedetection.io?src=github)

### Schedule web page watches in any timezone, limit by day of week and time.

Easily set a re-check schedule, for example you could limit the web page change detection to only operate during business hours.
Or perhaps based on a foreign timezone (for example, you want to check for the latest news-headlines in a foreign country at 0900 AM),

<img src="./docs/scheduler.png" style="max-width:80%;" alt="How to monitor web page changes according to a schedule"  title="How to monitor web page changes according to a schedule"  />

Includes quick short-cut buttons to setup a schedule for **business hours only**, or **weekends**.

### We have a Chrome extension!

Easily add the current web page to your changedetection.io tool, simply install the extension and click "Sync" to connect it to your existing changedetection.io install.

[<img src="./docs/chrome-extension-screenshot.png" style="max-width:80%;" alt="Chrome Extension to easily add the current web-page to detect a change."  title="Chrome Extension to easily add the current web-page to detect a change."  />](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/changedetectionio-website/kefcfmgmlhmankjmnbijimhofdjekbop)

[Goto the Chrome Webstore to download the extension.](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/changedetectionio-website/kefcfmgmlhmankjmnbijimhofdjekbop) ( Or check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io-browser-extension) )

## Filters

XPath(1.0), JSONPath, jq, and CSS support comes baked in! You can be as specific as you need, use XPath exported from various XPath element query creation tools. 
(We support LXML `re:test`, `re:match` and `re:replace`.)

## Notifications

ChangeDetection.io supports a massive amount of notifications (including email, office365, custom APIs, etc) when a web-page has a change detected thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/caronc/apprise">apprise</a> library.
Simply set one or more notification URL's in the _[edit]_ tab of that watch.

Just some examples

    discord://webhook_id/webhook_token
    flock://app_token/g:channel_id
    gitter://token/room
    gchat://workspace/key/token
    msteams://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC/
    o365://TenantID:AccountEmail/ClientID/ClientSecret/TargetEmail
    rocket://user:password@hostname/#Channel
    mailto://user:pass@example.com?to=receivingAddress@example.com
    json://someserver.com/custom-api
    syslog://
 
<a href="https://github.com/caronc/apprise#popular-notification-services">And everything else in this list!</a>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/screenshot-notifications.png" style="max-width:100%;" alt="Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications"  title="Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications"  />

Now you can also customise your notification content and use <a target="_new" href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/">Jinja2 templating</a> for their title and body!

## JSON API Monitoring

Detect changes and monitor data in JSON API's by using either JSONPath or jq to filter, parse, and restructure JSON as needed.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-filter-field-example.png)

This will re-parse the JSON and apply formatting to the text, making it super easy to monitor and detect changes in JSON API results

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-diff-example.png)

### JSONPath or jq?

For more complex parsing, filtering, and modifying of JSON data, jq is recommended due to the built-in operators and functions. Refer to the [documentation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for more specific information on jq.

One big advantage of `jq` is that you can use logic in your JSON filter, such as filters to only show items that have a value greater than/less than etc.

See the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help for more information and examples

### Parse JSON embedded in HTML!

When you enable a `json:` or `jq:` filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites. 

```
<html>
...
<script type="application/ld+json">

{
   "@context":"http://schema.org/",
   "@type":"Product",
   "offers":{
      "@type":"Offer",
      "availability":"http://schema.org/InStock",
      "price":"3949.99",
      "priceCurrency":"USD",
      "url":"https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-000D-001T1"
   },
   "description":"Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC",
   "name":"Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC",
   "sku":"3D5-000D-001T1",
   "itemCondition":"NewCondition"
}
</script>
```  

`json:$..price` or `jq:..price` would give `3949.99`, or you can extract the whole structure (use a JSONpath test website to validate with)

The application also supports notifying you that it can follow this information automatically


## Proxy Configuration

See the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration , we also support using [Bright Data proxy services where possible](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration#brightdata-proxy-support) and [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/SH2d) proxy services.

## Raspberry Pi support?

Raspberry Pi and linux/arm/v6 linux/arm/v7 arm64 devices are supported! See the wiki for [details](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Fetching-pages-with-WebDriver)

## Import support

Easily [import your list of websites to watch for changes in Excel .xslx file format](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/how-import-your-website-change-detection-lists-excel), or paste in lists of website URLs as plaintext. 

Excel import is recommended - that way you can better organise tags/groups of websites and other features.


## API Support

Supports managing the website watch list [via our API](https://changedetection.io/docs/api_v1/index.html)
